            A central figure in the “green revolution”, Norman Ernest Borlaug
            (born March 25, 1914) was born on a farm near Cresco, Iowa, to Henry
            and Clara Borlaug. For the past twenty-seven years he has
            collaborated with Mexican scientists on problems of wheat
            improvement; for the last ten or so of those years he has also
            collaborated with scientists from other parts of the world,
            especially from India and Pakistan, in adapting the new wheats to
            new lands and in gaining acceptance for their production
          </p>
          <p>
            An eclectic, pragmatic, goal-oriented scientist, he accepts and
            discards methods or results in a constant search for more fruitful
            and effective ones, while at the same time avoiding the pursuit of
            what he calls “academic butterflies”. A vigorous man who can perform
            prodigies of manual labor in the fields, he brings to his work the
            body and competitive spirit of the trained athlete, which indeed he
            was in his high school and college days.
          </p>
          <p>
            After completing his primary and secondary education in Cresco,
            Borlaug enrolled in the University of Minnesota where he studied
            forestry. Immediately before and immediately after receiving his
            Bachelor of Science degree in 1937, he worked for the U.S. Forestry
            Service at stations in Massachusetts and Idaho. Returning to the
            University of Minnesota to study plant pathology, he received the
            master’s degree in 1939 and the doctorate in 1942.
          </p>
          <p>
            From 1942 to 1944, he was a microbiologist on the staff of the du
            Pont de Nemours Foundation where he was in charge of research on
            industrial and agricultural bactericides, fungicides, and
            preservatives.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1944 he accepted an appointment as geneticist and plant
            pathologist assigned the task of organizing and directing the
            Cooperative Wheat Research and Production Program in Mexico. This
            program, a joint undertaking by the Mexican government and the
            Rockefeller Foundation, involved scientific research in genetics,
            plant breeding, plant pathology, entomology, agronomy, soil science,
            and cereal technology. Within twenty years he was spectacularly
            successful in finding a high-yielding short-strawed,
            disease-resistant wheat.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to the Nobel Peace Prize, Dr. Borlaug has received
            extensive recognition from universities and organizations in six
            countries: Canada, India, Mexico, Norway, Pakistan, the United
            States. In 1968 he received an especially satisfying tribute when
            the people of Ciudad Obregon, Sonora, Mexico, in whose area he did
            some of his first experimenting, named a street in his honor.
